Series of guidelines to learn TypeScript in a fun way
Before we start follow-up [ng2-demo](https://github.com/MurshidHassen/ng2-demo) and set-up your directory

# Ng2Demo Modified (FB-Clone)

Credits to Original Authors from [@99xt](https://github.com/99xt): Shamal Perera and Kripa Jayakumar
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.
A simple demo project demonstrating the basic concepts of Angular 2. I will modify the original code to build a simple FB.
This is how I have planned of teaching myself typescript :)  

# Usage

* Clone or fork this repository
* Make sure you have node.js installed version 5+
* Make sure you have NPM installed version 3+
* run `npm install` to install dependencies
* run `npm start` to fire up dev server
* open browser to http://localhost:4200
* if you want to use other port, open package.json file, then change port in --port 4200 script

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng serve --open` to automatically open the app in the browser

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
